# flower_of_life_002
Processing Code to create a SVG flower_of_life
The file flower_of_life_210r.svg has had duplicate circles and paths manually removed
I have since found out that an extension for Inscape exists to do this 
see: https://cutlings.datafil.no/inkscape-extension-removeduplicatelines/
I have not tested this out yet.
